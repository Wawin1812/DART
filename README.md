Challenge for sorting

Assupmtions

1. I have considered to sort based on two columns and produce the top three results for the csv file. 

Procedure

>Read the csv file using a FileInputStream
>Once the file have been loaded, they are added to a arraylist line by line. 
>To compare the column values i have used Comparator to sort the values and comapare them based on ascending and desending order. 
>The comparator compares the value based on the first column and followed by the second column. 
>The final values are stored in the output.csv file after execution.
